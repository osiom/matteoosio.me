# Matteo Osio

🪐 Berlin‑based tech worker cultivating sustainable, self‑hosted mesh networks for collective autonomy and digital emancipation.

## Values

I believe in technology as a tool for liberation—not exploitation. My work explores resilient, human‑centered systems that prioritize:

- **Sustainability**: Minimal‑impact, low‑resource infrastructure  
- **Self‑hosting**: Owning our digital lives with local‑first over corporate clouds  
- **Decentralization**: Mesh networks and federated alternatives as instruments of resiliency
- **Mutual Aid**: Building tools that serve communities, not capital  
- **Data Ownership**: Transparency, consent, and sovereignty in information flows  

> Inspired by *[Adriano Olivetti’s città dell’uomo](https://www.archiviostoricolivetti.it/en/prodotto/city-of-man/)*—I see tech as a way to nurture community, not dominate it.

## 🛠 Work

### 🪠 Data Engineering (Professional Backbone)

- Built ETL systems and data infrastructure powering 500+ production datasets  
- 8000+ commits across multi‑team environments in corporate
- Designed platforms supporting 200+ users in analytics, operation research, and ML pipelines  
- Passion for clean, sustainable and observable systems

This foundation enables my pivot toward **data as empowerment**, where visualization, transparency, and storytelling serve civic engagement and collective agency.
