# Matteo Osio

🌱 Berlin‑based technologist cultivating sustainable, self‑hosted mesh networks for collective autonomy and digital emancipation.

## 🌍 Values

I believe in technology as a tool for liberation—not exploitation. My work explores resilient, human‑centered systems that prioritize:

- **Sustainability**: Minimal‑impact, low‑resource infrastructure  
- **Self‑hosting**: Owning our digital lives with local‑first, server‑less architecture  
- **Decentralization**: Mesh networks and federated alternatives over corporate clouds  
- **Mutual Aid**: Building tools that serve communities, not capital  
- **Data Ownership**: Transparency, consent, and sovereignty in information flows  

> Inspired by *Adriano Olivetti’s città dell’uomo*—I see tech as a way to nurture community, not dominate it.

## 🛠 Work & Transition

### 📊 Data Engineering (My Professional Backbone)

- Built ETL systems and data infrastructure powering 500+ production datasets  
- 7000+ commits across multi‑team environments in public sector and civic tech  
- Designed platforms supporting 200+ users in analytics, optimization, and ML pipelines  
- Passion for clean, observable systems and operational resiliency  

This foundation enables my pivot toward **data as empowerment**, where visualization, transparency, and storytelling serve civic engagement and collective agency.

## Current Focus

### 🌐 Self‑Hosted Systems

- Running [mos‑erver.dev](https://mos‑erver.dev): my personal sovereign infrastructure stack  
- Hosting privacy‑first tools, experimental services, and off‑grid backups  

### 📡 Mesh & LoRa Networks

- Developing low‑power long‑range mesh networks with **Meshtastic** for resilient, off‑cloud communication  
- Exploring peer‑to‑peer protocols, radio beacons, and alternative internet topologies  

### 🧭 Data for Mutual Aid

- Reviving data visualization and data journalism for civic engagement  
- Prototyping pipelines for **community‑owned datasets**, prioritizing participatory input, auditability and sustainability.

## 🎧 Sound & Signal

Parallel to tech work, I engage in:

- Modular synthesis, field recording, and algorithmic audio systems  
- Curated listening sessions in bars across Berlin, exploring collective listening and experimental sound  
- Exploration via Berlin’s audio cultures and digital radio such as NTS and Keep It Radio
