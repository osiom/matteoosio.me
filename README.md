# Matteo Osio

Technologist & data engineer in Berlin | Passionate about open source, peer-to-peer networks, and technology that empowers individuals and communities for digital autonomy.

## 🔭 Vision

Technology obsessed by nature — fascinated by everything from low-level systems to distributed architectures. Developing solutions that challenge centralized, corporate-owned models and reject cloud computing as a tool of control. Designing systems that support alternative ways of connecting and creating.

- **Open Source**: Contributing to commons-based knowledge and tools
- **Decentralized**: P2P networks, federation, and alternatives to centralized control
- **Independent**: Full ownership of data and technological sovereignty
- **Sustainable**: Low-impact solutions for a post-carbon world
- **Community**: Technology that serves human needs

## 💾 Professional Work

Day job: wrangling distributed systems and making machines learn faster. Spent years optimizing ML/AI pipelines with Apache Spark — squeezing performance out of massive parallel processing. Built data infrastructure from the ground up, mass-designed ETL pipelines, and shipped an operations research platform used by 200+ people.

## 🔧 Tech Explorations

- **Self-hosting**: Designing infrastructures for digital sovereignty, privacy, and tech emancipation
- **P2P Networks**: Building and exploring decentralized communication systems
- **Meshtastic & LoRa**: Resilient, off-grid communication networks
- **Open Data & Digital Archives**: Cultural heritage digitization and open data pipelines contributor
